# Why we used postgressql/ Relational DB
Our project is  an e-commerce web app that handles well-structured data, for that our right choice for handling the data was the relational database. The primary reasons for our choice was that  the tables standardize the data, it makes it easier to store, update and retrieve specific datasets using SQL queries. This data can be more easily formed into accurate reports as itâ€™s all in one format. Another benefit of relational databases is that the different tables can relate to each other, with fields in one table being referenced in another table. This is referred to as normalization, and helps to reduce data deduplication. This term means that redundant data is eliminated as much as possible.
